This is the document in which I document the thought process and decision making behind the products I produce whilst working towards the learning outcomes for semester 3.

## About Raccool
Raccool is the project in which I will work towards the learning outcomes for the individual project. <br>

This project consists of a web application built with React and a backend built with Springboot and Kotlin. <br>
Data persistency will be achieved through the use of SQL databases. <br>

The aim of the web application is create a place where users can find raccoons that they like and add them to their 'raccoon collection'. The raccoons will be randomly generated using data stored in a database. When a user adds a racoon to their collection this collection will also be stored in a database for data persistency.

#### Why React?
React is a popular library used for frontend development. Because of this popularity it is a valuable library to gain experience with. <br>
Another benefit of using React is that React also allows you to build user interfaces relatively quickly, the learning curve isn't very steep. <br>
The final reason to use React is that the component based design is something I find very appealing.

#### Why Kotlin?
Kotlin came recommended to me by a friend who works as a senior developer. <br>
Kotlin's ability to integrate with java code and its handling being more similar to languages such as C# were listed as reasons. <br>

As I have experience with C# this made Kotlin an appealing choice.

#### Why SQL?
The data intended to be stored within this project is small and very few relations will exist. Because of this scalability will be unlikely to become an issue. <br>
Because of this I do not expect noSQL to give me significant benefits over SQL.

## Beginning of the project
User stories were made and are visible on the project board.
